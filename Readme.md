# E-Commerce Backend API

## Overview

Simple backend application for an e-commerce application I developed for a job interview at Onebox.
This application allows users to create shopping carts, add products to them, retrieve cart details and delete them.
Since this is a simple test, no database is required.

All endpoints can be found here once project runs: [Swagger UI] http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
